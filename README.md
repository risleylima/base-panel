# BASE ADMIN PANEL 

With this repo, I intended to make the base for fast initiate projects that uses an admin panel.

### Based on: 
- [Angular](https://angular.io)
- [Nebular](https://akveo.github.io/nebular/)
### Uses:
- [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
- [JSON Web Tokens](https://jwt.io)
- [MomentJS](https://momentjs.com/)

It is ready for use with PWA!
